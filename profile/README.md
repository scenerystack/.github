SceneryStack is an open-source TypeScript framework designed to create powerful, interactive, and accessible web experiences. SceneryStack offers web development libraries for building engaging simulations, educational tools, or next-generation web applications. Included is support for robust accessibility features like dynamic screen-reader descriptions and alternative input (e.g., keyboard navigation).

SceneryStack is the development framework behind [PhET Interactive Simulations](https://phet.colorado.edu), where it powers STEM-focused interactives used by millions around the world. PhET continues to maintain and contribute to SceneryStack for the purposes of creating multimodal and accessible STEM interactives.

SceneryStack is in the early stages of transitioning to an independent open-source community, driven by a collective passion for a more people-friendly web.
